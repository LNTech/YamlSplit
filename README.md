### Features

# YamlSplit
Splits a treatment.yaml file into 3 parts

The .yaml file provided is only an example, you should specify the directory where the desired treatment.yaml file is located using --filepath or -f when using this script.

**Help**
--filepath [-f] = Location of .yaml file you wish to split, this string should not contain the name of the .yaml file.

Alternatively
You can run this script in the same directory as the treatment.yaml file and it will find it automatically, I would not recommend this though
