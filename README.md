# YamlSplit
Splits a treatment.yaml file into 3 parts


**How to run**

python3 splitter.py -f < filepath >

--filepath [-f] < filepath > is the directory the treatment.yaml file is stored in, this string should not contain the name of the yaml file.

Alternatively
You can run this script in the same directory as the treatment.yaml file and it will find it automatically, I would not recommend this though
